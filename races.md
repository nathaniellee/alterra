## Elves

### Eldanari

/ˌeldəˈnärē/

More commonly referred to as high elves -- specifically “sun” or “gold” elves -- outside of their communities, the Eldanari are the stereotypical haughty, elitist isolationists who believe themselves to be superior to most races -- including other elves -- and generally avoid contact with them. Most never cross the borders of their home state of El’avandreil and so it is very rare to encounter an Eldanari adventurer. Furthermore, Eldanari as a society are intolerant of interracial marriages so a half-elf with Eldanari lineage is rare and viewed as a pariah by their elven relatives.

The Eldanari’s keen minds and natural affinity for magic lead many to become practitioners of the arcane arts in some form. Most who devote themselves to formal studies become wizards of exceptional skill although some weave a study of magic into their pursuit of the fine and performing arts. Still others learn to focus their raw magical talents into their martial training, becoming the spellblades and arcane archers that defend El’avandreil from enemies of the elven nations.

Like most other elves the Eldanari tend to be slightly shorter than humans and much more lithe with the average height and weight for a male high elf being 5’5” and 118 lbs., respectively. They typically have fair, bronze-colored skin and golden blond, black or copper hair with green, gold, silver or black eyes.

### Selunari

/seˌlo͞oˈnärē/

Known by most as “moon” or “silver” elves, the Selunari are descendants of the Eldanari that left to form their own society over social discrimination stemming from the caste system and the extreme isolationist views of the ruling caste.

While some still exhibit hints of the arrogance that many races typically attribute to high elves the Selunari are for the most part more open with outsiders than their Eldanari cousins: the Selunari state of Sel’unestreil has diplomatic relations with several non-elf communities. Nevertheless they share the Eldanari’s aversion to interracial marriages so half-elves with Selunari lineage are uncommon.

Much like the Eldanari, the Selunari are highly intelligent and prone to innate magical ability with many pursuing mastery of the arcane arts at an early age. Those who go down this path tend to end up as wizards although the fey-blessed often leverage their raw talent to become sorcerers. Warlocks of the Archfey are also not unheard of, and the Sel’unestreil guard is full of skilled warriors who have learned to augment their martial prowess with magic.

The Selunari typically have pale, alabaster skin often tinged with an icy blue hue and silver-white, black or blue hair. Their eyes are usually blue or green and flecked with gold. While they diverged from the Eldanari in their pigmentation, they still share the same physical characteristics with the average male being 5’5” and 118 lbs.

### Sylvanari

/ˌsilvaˈnärē/

Commonly referred to as “wood” elves, the Sylvanari are the elf subrace most often encountered outside of the elven communities of Alterra. In contrast to the rather standoffish, dismissive nature of many of their high elf cousins, Sylvanari tend to have amiable relations with other races. Their predilection to exploration has resulted in the establishment of many colonies in forests across the continents. The majority of half-elves are of Sylvanari lineage.

The Sylvanari have remained much more aligned with nature than their Eldanari and Selunari counterparts and so their communities tend towards a flatter, less elaborate architecture and a more rustic and natural design aesthetic. They are uncomfortable in more urban settings like cities and fortresses, preferring to live in the forests over which they guard. Most have an aversion toward the arcane arts: Sylvanari adventurers typically follow the path of the fighter, barbarian, ranger or rogue with the more religious individuals engaging in druidic studies. 

Sylvanari are distinguished from other elves by the coppery hue of their skin and their green, brown or hazel eyes. They typically have black or brown hair although blonde and coppery red hair is not uncommon. The average male is 5’5” and 128 lbs.

### Kaelanari

/ˌkāelaˈnärē/

The Kaelanari are direct descendants of the original Alterran elves from which all other subraces diverged. They are a reclusive society, but this stems not from any belief of superiority over other people but rather a sense of distrust cultivated through centuries of discrimination manifested in their treatment as a “slave” lower caste by the Eldanari and even the Selunari. In fact, there is still a palpable tension despite the progress that has been made between the societies in the two centuries (a relatively short time from an elven perspective) since the Kaelanari were given official representation in the Quen’thaneas High Council.

As a people the Kaelanari are much more attuned to the natural world than even their Sylvanari cousins. They live in harmony with the plants and animals that flourish in their lush realms and rarely construct anything beyond simple tree houses -- many instead choose to live in caves -- as permanent structures prevents them from roaming freely. Their ability to move stealthily in the forested areas they call home and disappear quickly into the trees and underbrush along with their more primitive aesthetic has led many to commonly refer to them as “wild” elves.

Kaelanari lost the ability to harness powerful arcane magic, but some follow the path of the druid and a few become clerics in the service of Melora, Pelor or Sehanine. They are much more likely to become fighters, rangers, barbarians, and very rarely bards (College of Swords or College of Valor).

The Kaelanari’s active lifestyle and heartier physiques put them on the larger side as far as elves go with the average male being 5’5” and 128 lbs. They tend to have darker skin tones ranging from light brown to dark brown, and many adorn themselves with tribal tattoos on various parts of their bodies including their faces to symbolize their close relationship with nature. Their eyes are usually hazel, and their hair color ranges from light brown to black.

### Vaelenari

/ˌvāeleˈnärē/

The Vaelenari, or “shadow” elves as they are more commonly known, are members of a subrace of elves who only recently emerged from deep within the earth after thousands of years of exile to reclaim their place in the elven nation of Quen’thenaes.

Their ancestors were members of a sect of Eldanari who were magically bred for physical strength and trained for martial prowess which, when combined with their innate affinity for magic, made them formidable warriors. They proved this during the Great Cataclysm when their superiority on the battlefield directly led to victories that pushed back the conquering forces of Gruumsh and ultimately ended the war.

Ironically these contributions sealed the warriors’ fates: the rest of the Eldanari viewed the viciousness with which they fought and the unconscionable tactics they were willing to use as evidence of how dangerous they had become and led them to imprison them underground, sealed away by powerful magic.

After many centuries of an ongoing but intermittent war -- one which consisted mostly of raids, skirmishes and assassination attempts by smaller war bands who had found ways out of the underworld -- a large delegate of exiles made their way to Quen’thenaes with information on the vast, ruthless empire built by exiles who had embraced their darkest nature and planned to eventually return to the surface to seek revenge on those who had ostracized them. They were ultimately able to negotiate official recognition within the elven nation and even representation on the High Council after a century of peaceful co-existence although there remains a degree of palpable suspicion on both sides due to their history. The terms of this truce do not apply to the exiles who have remained underground whose lineages remain stricken from all elven records.

Vaelenari are easily recognizable by the dark grey tone -- with a slight purple hue -- of their skin, which has only slightly lightened in the many decades since their return to the surface. By contrast, those elves who have remained exiled are said to have obsidian black skin that matches the utter darkness in which they exist for much of their lives.

While many Vaelenari still retain the stark white or silvery hair color their people developed underground, perhaps equally many have seen some pigmentation return, leading to light or even, in fewer cases, golden blonde hair. Similarly, eye color has also intensified with red, blue, purple and silver as possible options -- the eyes of exiles are pale shades of those colors to the point of almost being white -- but they have not yet been able to rid themselves of sensitivity to sunlight.

Vaelenari are slightly larger physical specimens than other elves due to the nature of their original breeding with the average height and weight for a male being 5’7” and 138 lbs., respectively.

## Dwarves

### Thoringrim

/ˈTHôrˌingrim/

One of three clans of mountain dwarves that reside in Bhuldarohm, the Thoringrim comprise the noble caste of the Three Kingdoms and are commonly referred to by other races as “stone dwarves.” Most bureaucratic and diplomatic activity in Bhuldarohm takes place within the walls of the Thoringrim kingdom of Stoneheim, and the largest dwarven temple dedicated to Moradin on the entire planet is maintained by Thoringrim priests.

While the Thoringrim would prefer to deal only with their dwarven brethren, a perspective shared by most mountain dwarves, they at least acknowledge the benefits of diplomatic and trade relationships with other societies. They leave the majority of business dealings to the Kadralgrim but handle almost all diplomatic efforts, making the stone dwarves the most likely Bhuldarohm clan that any non-dwarven individual will ever interact with.

Despite handling the “softer” responsibilities of the Three Kingdoms, the Thoringrim are still very much immersed in the more physical aspects of dwarven culture with even the most learned arcanists from the Thunderbrawn school of wizardry trained in the use of hammers and axes as instruments of combat. The rare Thoringrim adventurer is most likely to be a fighter, but clerics of Moradin are not unheard of. Wizards are less common, as are skalds, dwarven bards of the College of Discord, College of Swords or College of Valor who inspire ferocity in their allies by rhythmically beating their hammers or axes against their armor or shields.

The Thoringrim tend to have a fair complexion with a wide range of hair color including all shades of brown, black and red -- a small percentage of the population even has dark blonde hair. They usually keep their beards neatly trimmed and on the shorter end, but they often grow their hair quite long to shoulder length and beyond. Braids are very popular, including in the beards of those Thoringrim who choose to grow them out longer. The average height for a stone dwarf is 4’5”, and the average weight is 155 lbs.

### Kadralgrim

/ˈkäˌdrəlgrim/

The hearty Kadralgrim, a clan of mountain dwarves commonly referred to as “forge dwarves”, reside in the dwarven kingdom of Rockheim where they spend their long lives forging some of the most exquisite and finely crafted armor, weapons and metal goods in Avera, if not all of Alterra.

Like all mountain dwarves, the Kadralgrim care little in the affairs of the outside world, but they nevertheless have fairly decent trade relations with the elven, halfling, gnomish, and human nations on the continent: gold is gold, after all.

The Kadralgrim have little use for magic in their lives of metalwork and stonecraft -- they view the arcane arts as nonsense for foolish bookworms and leave the divine practices to the clergy -- and tend to end up as fighters or, more rarely, barbarians. As they rarely adventure in the outside world, they hone their athletic and combat skills in their colosseum where citizens from not just Rockheim but Stoneheim as well regularly gather to enjoy fair, but often times brutal, competition.

As with all dwarves there is no significant height or weight gap between the genders with the typical male or female Kadralgrim standing 4’5” tall and weighing 165 lbs. They typically have fair, bronze-colored skin and copper, brown or, less commonly, black hair. They are not as concerned with their grooming as their Thoringrim and Daargrim cousins so their beards tend to be long and bushy.

### Daargrim

/ˈdärgrim/

The militaristic Daargrim serve as the warrior caste of Bhuldarohm, ready to defend the Three Kingdoms from their fortress in Cragheim. The entirety of their lives is dedicated to honing their combat skills and military prowess in preparation for any large scale conflict that may come their way. While the Thoringrim and Kadralgrim clans have produced some fine warriors, the elite soldiers of the Daargrim army rely not just on brute strength but also their training in battlefield strategy and tactics. Thus, while many members of clan Daargrim follow the path of the fighter or barbarian, it is equally likely that they train as cavaliers or paladins.

The most closed off members of dwarven society, the Daargrim have little interest in the affairs of other races and rarely leave Cragheim. Most, in fact, have never seen a non-dwarf and prefer to keep it that way: one is highly unlikely to encounter an iron dwarf adventurer. Nevertheless, the few outsiders who actually know of their existence (mainly elven bureaucrats, diplomats and historians from Quen’thaneas and halfling merchants from the Hearthlands) commonly refer to them as “steel dwarves” in reference to their powerful armor and weapons (despite those items having actually been forged by the Kadralgrim).

The Daargrim tend to have fair skin and short to medium length dark brown or black hair with meticulously groomed beards and mustaches styled in the particular fashion associated with their squad. Female Daargrim also grow beards although they keep theirs trimmed much closer to the face. The average height and weight, regardless of gender, is 4’5” and 165 lbs.

### Mhulgrim

/ˈməlgrim/

The bitter and distrustful Mhulgrim, also known as “dark dwarves”, are a wholly evil and tyrannical subrace of dwarves who dwell deep underground in the city of Voggarohm, an elaborate, fortified stronghold constructed in the stone walls of an enormous subterranean cavern.

They were exiled from Bhuldarohm ages ago due to their conniving and treacherous nature and their tendency towards violence. Left to fester for centuries on end, these characteristics have only gotten worse: the modern Mhulgrim are vicious slavers who frequently raid the surface to take slaves to use as free labor. They in fact view random slaughter of enemies to be a waste of precious resources and prefer that their foes suffer the rest of their lives toiling away in the dark depths with exceptions sometimes made for surface dwarves towards whom they harbor an intense animosity.

Mhulgrim are slightly shorter than mountain dwarves and a little taller than hill dwarves with an average height of 4’4”, and they are significantly denser and stockier than other dwarves with an average weight of 185 lbs. Males and even many females tend to be bald although some grow stiff, wiry hair that ranges from light gray to a stark white color. Mhulgrim skin tone is always some shade of ashen grey that matches their drab stone environment, and they have dull, white eyes that seem almost lifeless.
